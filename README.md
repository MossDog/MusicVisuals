## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
The idea of this project was to have a television visualisation taking inspiration from the Rap God music video, to get that similar feeling and environment when you use our program. In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA), you can see him appear on the TV with some cool colour visualization in the background and we felt that this would be a good idea to base our project around. We developed a TV with six different visuals that appear on the screen, along with buttons on the TV that you can interact with to change the visual or to pause / play it. We each created two different visualizations to give a plethora of options to use to visualize the song as it reaches over six minutes in length.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
